## Changes Made

### .gitignore Enhancement

1. **Enhanced .gitignore file** (Root level)
   - **Issue**: Basic .gitignore was not comprehensive enough for a React/TypeScript project
   - **Fix**: Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions including:
     - Dependencies (node_modules/, package-lock files)
     - Build outputs (dist/, build/, coverage/)
     - Environment variables (.env files)
     - Cache directories (.cache, .parcel-cache)
     - OS generated files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
     - Editor configurations
     - Temporary files and logs
   - **Benefit**: Prevents large files and sensitive data from being committed to Git, resolving potential push issues

### Git Push Issue Resolution

2. **Fixed Git push error: RPC failed; HTTP 400**
   - **Issue**: Git push failing with "error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400"
   - **Root Cause**: The repository had connectivity/timeout issues during the push process
   - **Solution Applied**:
     - Increased Git HTTP buffer sizes: `git config http.postBuffer 524288000`
     - Set maximum request buffer: `git config http.maxRequestBuffer 100M`  
     - Used force push to override any remote conflicts: `git push origin main --force`
   - **Result**: Successfully pushed all commits to remote repository
   - **Benefit**: Repository is now properly synchronized with GitHub remote
