## Changes Made

### .gitignore Enhancement

1. **Enhanced .gitignore file** (Root level)
   - **Issue**: Basic .gitignore was not comprehensive enough for a React/TypeScript project
   - **Fix**: Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions including:
     - Dependencies (node_modules/, package-lock files)
     - Build outputs (dist/, build/, coverage/)
     - Environment variables (.env files)
     - Cache directories (.cache, .parcel-cache)
     - OS generated files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
     - Editor configurations
     - Temporary files and logs
   - **Benefit**: Prevents large files and sensitive data from being committed to Git, resolving potential push issues
